# Short Overview

## What is Dmeta?

Dmeta is a standalone metadata tracking system that also integrates
automated data processing pipelines and data analysis and visualization
modules to support a wide variety of use cases from basic to complex,
multi-organization/lab-based projects. It seamlessly communicates with
data processing servers (e.g.
[DolphinNext](https://dolphinnext.umassmed.edu/)) and analysis and
visualization servers (e.g. Dportal)

### Benefits of the design

-   **Flexible Design:** Define project collection and fields flexibly
    with a software architecture developed by MongoDB data management
    system. MongoDB allows a flexible data field schema where users can
    efficiently update data fields of any entry or information of the
    associated metadata.
-   **WEB APIs:** Dmeta also incorporates extensive and secure
    token-based WEB APIs to make the metadata and processed data
    available to its users in FAIR standards.
-   **Integration with 3rd parties:** Dmeta is fully integrated with
    data browsing and preprocessing platforms Dportal and Dnext, but in
    addition to these platforms, other pipeline management and data
    portal systems can be integrated for data preprocessing and
    analysis.
-   **Event-based Management:** Events are specific types of insert,
    delete and edit operations that are defined by the project
    administrators to allow internal users to manage multiple permitted
    fields and collection in an organized manner.
-   **Validation with Ontology Servers:** Data fields linked to ontology
    servers or user admin specified dictionaries which allows collecting
    the information in a standardized way from each user.
-   **Share:** Each project, collection, field, and document in Dmeta
    have its permission description which allows you to limit the
    access, update or submit operations to specified groups or users.

## Who is Dmeta for?

Dmeta is designed for a wide variety of users, from bench biologists to
expert bioinformaticians.

-   **Data submission** requires no programming knowledge and we aim to
    create an event-based approach to simplify this process.
-   **Metadata setup** requires basic database knowledge, and
    familiarization with MongoDB to effectively use its operators. You
    don\'t need to learn all of the MongoDB syntaxes, instead, you can
    easily focus on the field settings. The rest is handled by Dmeta
    (e.g. creating parent-child relationships with collections,
    delivering data from ontology servers, etc.)

# Multiple Input Problem

## Course Introduction

Welcome to this training module on resolving common issues in pipeline development. Nextflow is a powerful tool designed to simplify the deployment of computational pipelines, making it an invaluable resource for researchers and bioinformaticians. This course aims to address a specific challenge many users face when configuring pipelines to handle multiple inputs: ensuring unique output filenames to prevent data loss through overwriting. By the end of this module, you will understand how to modify your Nextflow scripts to dynamically generate output filenames, preserving the integrity of your results across multiple runs.
      
## Problem Statement

When developing a Nextflow pipeline, it's common to design workflows that accept multiple input files for processing. This flexibility is one of Nextflow's strengths, allowing for scalable and reproducible analysis across various datasets. However, a frequent issue arises when the pipeline is configured to generate outputs with static, unchanging filenames. In scenarios where the pipeline processes multiple input files, the risk of subsequent runs overwriting previous results becomes a significant concern. This overwriting occurs because each run generates outputs with identical filenames, leading to data loss and compromised analysis integrity.

Consider a pipeline designed to analyze genomic sequences, outputting a summary file named `results.txt` for each input. If multiple inputs are processed in parallel or in quick succession without changing the output filename, only the last completed run's results will be preserved. This issue undermines the pipeline's reliability, as valuable data from earlier analyses are lost.

```groovy
script:
"""
samtools view -c $bam > counts_file.txt
"""
```

## Solution

The solution to preventing output file overwriting in Nextflow pipelines lies in implementing dynamic output naming. This approach involves modifying the Nextflow script to generate unique filenames for each run or for each input file, ensuring that every output is preserved independently. Dynamic output naming can be achieved through various strategies, including appending timestamps, unique identifiers, or input file-specific information to the output filenames.

### Implementing Dynamic Output Naming

Here's a step-by-step guide to modify your pipeline script for dynamic output naming:

1. **Identify Outputs**: Review your process outputs and look at the defined outputs.

2. **Modify Filename Generation**: Change the static filename to include dynamic elements. This can be done using Nextflow's built-in variables or custom code to append unique identifiers.

3. **Run and Validate**: Execute your modified pipeline with multiple inputs to ensure that each output file has a unique name and that no overwriting occurs.

## Conclusion

Adopting dynamic output naming in your pipelines is crucial for preserving the integrity of your analysis results across multiple runs. By implementing the strategies outlined above, you can ensure that each output is uniquely identified, avoiding the pitfalls of data loss through overwriting. This practice not only enhances the reliability of your pipelines but also supports more organized data management and retrieval for downstream analysis.
